# Update: This repo is now unmainted. Please see new supabase repo: https://github.com/flashblaze/notesbin-supabase and new domain: https://notes.flashblaze.xyz/

## Background

While sharing some code snippets with a friend we would always use [hastebin](https://hastebin.com), but recently the app has stopped working and we started using [pastebin](https://pastebin.com). While there is nothing wrong with pastebin, we really liked the minimal UI of hastebin and the [open source](https://github.com/seejohnrun/haste-server) nature of it. This inspired me to create [notesbin](https://notesbin.xyz).

## Directory structure

The app is divided into two directories:

[client](https://github.com/FlashBlaze/notesbin/tree/main/client) - Which is a [react](https://reactjs.org/) app.

[server](https://github.com/FlashBlaze/notesbin/tree/main/server) - Which is an [express](https://expressjs.com/) server.

## Hosting

The whole setup along with [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) analytics is currently deployed on the cheapest plan on [servercheap](https://servercheap.net/pricing.php).
